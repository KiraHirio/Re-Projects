🧩 1. Core Physics & Mechanics

These determine how the golf ball moves and reacts in the environment.

Ball Physics

Initial velocity (from swing force)

Launch angle

Spin rate (backspin, sidespin)

Ball mass and drag

Coefficient of restitution (bounciness)

Rolling friction

Air resistance (drag coefficient)

Lift (Magnus effect from spin)

Terrain interaction (grass, sand, water, rough, green)

Slope and incline influence

Swing Mechanics

Clubhead speed

Swing path and angle

Impact position on clubface (sweet spot, toe, heel)

Shot power percentage (charge bar)

Timing window (for arcade swings)

Player stance and posture modifiers

Swing type: full, chip, pitch, putt, flop, punch

⛳ 2. Golf Equipment Data

You’ll want to define data for each club type.

Club Types

Driver

Woods (3W, 5W)

Irons (1–9)

Wedges (PW, SW, LW)

Putter

Hybrid clubs

Club Stats

Loft angle (e.g., Driver ~10°, 9-Iron ~42°)

Shaft length

Swing weight

Sweet spot size

Max distance

Accuracy (dispersion)

Spin generation factor

Forgiveness (error tolerance)

🌳 3. Environment Data

The world affects the ball’s flight and rolling behavior.

Terrain Types

Fairway

Rough

Heavy rough

Green

Fringe

Sand bunker

Water hazard

Out of bounds

Tee box

Surface Physics

Friction coefficient

Bounce damping

Roll resistance

Weather

Wind speed & direction

Temperature (affects ball carry)

Humidity

Rain (affects friction)

Time of day (lighting)

Fog

🏌️‍♂️ 4. Player Data

Each player or character can have attributes affecting gameplay.

Stats

Power

Accuracy

Spin control

Putting skill

Stamina or fatigue

Experience level

Preferred clubs

Swing tempo

Character model (animation blending)

Skill Modifiers

Shot shaping (fade/draw)

Aim correction

Power boost (for arcade types)

Special shots (topspin, backspin control)

🏞️ 5. Course Data

The course is the main level design component.

Hole Info

Hole number

Par (3, 4, 5)

Yardage (tee to hole)

Hole layout path (Bezier spline or node path)

Tee positions

Pin position

Fairway width and curve

Bunker and hazard positions

Slope/heightmap (for terrain)

Global Course Data

Course name

Difficulty

Weather pattern

Total par

Number of holes (9 or 18)

Background ambience (birds, wind, crowd)

🎮 6. Gameplay Systems

Systems that handle interaction and progression.

Gameplay Rules

Stroke count

Par, birdie, eagle, bogey, etc.

OB (Out of Bounds) detection

Water hazard penalty

📈 7. AI & Simulation Data

If you include CPU opponents or auto-play systems.

AI shot accuracy rating

AI shot strategy (risk/reward)

Decision trees or shot probability maps

Difficulty modifiers

Random variation factor (realism)

🔊 8. Audio-Visual Data

Enhances immersion and feedback.

Audio

Swing SFX (impact, whoosh)

Ball bounce & roll

Crowd cheer or gasp

Ambience (wind, birds, ocean)

UI sounds

Visual

Ball trails

Impact dust or grass particles

Wind line indicator

Camera follow modes

Replay camera path

Post-processing (bloom, DOF)

💾 9. Data Structuring (Unity-Specific)

In Unity, you’ll likely store this as:

ScriptableObjects

ClubData, BallData, CourseData, WeatherData, PlayerStats

JSON files

For external course definitions or user-made levels

Physics Materials

For terrain surfaces (sand, grass, etc.)

Terrain heightmaps

Generated or imported from external tools (Blender, World Machine)

🧠 10. Optional Advanced Systems

If you’re going for realism or RPG-style features.

Wind turbulence simulation

Real-time deformation (ball marks on green)

Dynamic lighting/weather transition

Online leaderboard

Shot replay buffer system

Player progression (XP, leveling clubs)

Procedural course generation
